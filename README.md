# Frontend Challenge

This project was created as part of a take-home challenge for an interview process in 2021. 

The prompt was to create the user-facing interface for presenting a Demo that consists of several slides. The presentation component itself presents basic UI that lists slides on the left with main content on the right. Clicking on a slide should print the type of of slide, e.g. "Web", "Image", or "HTML". A stop button was also required and clicking this button should render the amount of time spent on each slide. 

I broke down the development of this UI using Atomic Design principles, and fleshed out the basic interface given the time constraints of the take-home (a few hours).
